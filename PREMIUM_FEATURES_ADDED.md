### 1. ⚠️ Weather Risk Scoring System (0-100)

**What it does:**
- Calculates a comprehensive risk score from 0-100 for your project

```
Risk Score = Weighted average of:

- Temperature Risk (25%): Extreme hot/cold conditions
- Wind Risk (20%): High wind day frequency
- Seasonal Risk (25%): Time of year factors
```

**Color-coded Risk Levels:**
- 🟢 0-25: LOW RISK (Excellent conditions)
- 🟡 26-50: MODERATE RISK (Acceptable with precautions)
- 🟠 51-75: HIGH RISK (Significant challenges expected)
